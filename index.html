            <h1>What?</h1>
            <p>If you made it this far, you're somewhat curious as to what you're reading. This is a website that
                servers
                two use cases, including a use case for front end development with an emphasis on responsive web design.
                If
                you're reading this on a phone, hopefully it's legible and stuff isn't all over the place. The whole
                point
                of responsive web design is that the content is legible across any device that it's being consumed on.
                The
                majority of what you're seeing is built primarily on CSS, with some JS thrown in here for good looks.
                The
                goal is to be able to format somewhat useful content while remaining lightweight.</p>
        </section>
        <div class="to-top"><a href="#top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-up"></i></a></div>
        <section id="why" class="section" data-aos="fade-in">
            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>Most of the why has already been covered, but honestly, cause I had an rPi laying around and wanted to
                put it
                to good use and learn some stuff. I always found myself creating docs to store links for resources that
                I
                need, might as well make a project out of it to document progress and expand the junk in my brain. This
                site initially started as a Wordpress site to host random information, but the eventual goal is where we
                are now, hosting static pages.</p>
        </section>
        <div class="to-top"><a href="#top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-up"></i></a></div>
        <section id="how" class="section" data-aos="fade-in">
            <h1>How?</h1>
            <p>The nerdy stuff...<br>
                Again, two uses cases, the first being learning RWD. The second is the rPi. Let's talk about the
                architecture:<br><br>
                Front end written completely in VSCode/neovim as I go back to my old school vi roots.<br>
                Versioning and commits are managed through GitHub via VSCode.<br>
                New builds are deployed on commit through CI pipelines.<br><br>
                Back end technologies include the host machine, a Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian Stretch.<br>
                Web server is nginx, with reverse proxy HTTPS redirect.<br>
                SSL certs are managed automatically through certbot and letsencrypt.<br>
                Both are leveraging Docker containers, managed with Compose.<br><br>
                To keep track of general server health, a TIG stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana) is also being managed
                through Docker containers.</p>
