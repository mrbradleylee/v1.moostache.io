            <div class="desc">So you want to be a bellionaire? Tips for turnip efficiency for the
                uninstantiated. Learn how to get rich
                quick by taking advantage of the "Stalk Market."</div>
            <h2>Quick Links</h2>
            <p><a href="http://turnipprophet.io" target="_blank">Turnip Prophet</a> | <a
                href="https://turnip.exchange/" target="_blank">Turnip Exchange</a></p>
            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p>What is the "Stalk Market?" The basic premise is simple, buy low, sell high. Since you're here, you
                already know the commodity is turnips. We'll cover the basics of turnips, including tools to help you
                buy and sell for bells you'll run out of use for soon.</p>

            <h2>Buying</h2>
            <p>Every Sunday, Daisy Mae, the little snot nosed fellow, will visit your paradise selling turnips in stacks
                of
                10. The prices range from 90-110 bells per stack of 10, and are tied to your island. Feel free to visit
                other islands if they have better prices, but note you can ONLY buy turnips on Sunday, between the
                island
                hours of 0800-1159. She scoots on the dot.</p>
            <h2>Selling</h2>
            <p>Turnips are sold at Nook's Cranny, by the sniveling little raccoons. They'll only buy turnips Monday thru
                Saturday, at varying prices that are set each day from M-F from 0800-1159, and change again from
                1200-2200. These follow set patterns per island, which we'll get to in a bit. Turnips will rot at 0500
                the following Sunday, so be sure to sell them by 2200 Saturday the week you buy them. Rotten turnips
                aren't entirely useless, but since we're here to make money, don't let em rot. Also, if you change your
                system clock, rot rot rot.</p>
            <h2>Simple enough, how do I get rich quick?</h2>

            <p>Taking advantage of the turnip market requires a few things, understanding the pricing patterns, and
                taking advantage of other people's hard work to find the best prices for buying and selling.</p>

            <h2>Turnip Prophet and patterns</h2>
            <p>Fortunately, for us common folk, the geniuses have data mined pretty much all of the available patterns
                for us. We know that there are 4 patterns available for your turnip prices, which are:</p>
            <code>
                Small Spike: caps out at around 220ish bells<br>
                Large Spike: all the way up to the 680ish<br>
                Fluctuating: caps out at 150ish<br>
                Decreasing: F
            </code>
            <p>How do you know which pattern you're getting this week? Here's where other people's hard work comes in,
                with a little bit of your own due-diligence. The lovely folks at the <a href="http://turnipprophet.io"
                    target="_blank">Turnip Prophet</a> have created a site where you can track your prices over the
                week, and it will reference those prices against the data mined patterns. As you enter more data, your
                available patterns will start to narrow down, and you can start making decisions on when you want to
                sell, or if you even want to sell on your island. Large spikes are obviously the desired pattern, and it
                helps to know when that spike is coming if you're lucky enough to get it. Your due diligence counts
                here, as the data accuracy is based on you knowing your prices every day. Also note that it's based on
                your purchase prices as well as your pattern from the week prior, so keep track of those!!</p>
            <h2>What if my prices suck?</h2>
            <p>Too bad, so sad. Or, start looking for randos! This is where the second set of resources come into play,
                the <a href="https://turnip.exchange/" target="_blank">Turnip Exchange</a>. The turnip exchange allows you to both host
                islands for selling your turnips (to
                rake in some profits if you got a large spike and want to share the wealth) or hunt for islands with
                high turnip prices. We'll focus on the latter here, but be aware that turnip prices over ~450 can net
                you a pretty profit in fees and tips if you want to go through the pain of hosting.</p>
            <p>For selling, head to the islands and find placard that have both the prices you want, and the fees that
                are palatable to you. Some of it is pretty overboard these days in the 500+ range, asking for an entire
                stack of NMTs and furniture and gold nuggets and 10% of your turnips... Up to you if you want to
                contribute to that mess. If you're lucky enough to get into a queue, let the waiting game begin. Long
                story short, you hit the front of the line, get your DODO code, fly out and get rich!</p>
            <p> And that's pretty much all there is to it, go get your Bellionaire title!</p>

            <h1>Tool Durability</h1>
            <div class="desc">All your tools are going to break, see how long each type of tool will last
                and decide if upgrading them is right for you.</div>
            <h2>Types of tools</h2>
            <p>At this point, you're probably already familiar with all the different tools in the game, and we'll
                introduce the different variations as well. All tools listed below, along with variants:</p>
            <code>
                Axe (Flimsy, Stone, Gold)<br>
                Shovel (Flimsy, Colorful, Outdoorsy, Printed, Gold)<br>
                Net (Flimsy, Colorful, Outdoorsy, Star, Gold)<br>
                Fishing Rod (Flimsy, Colorful, Outdoorsy, Fish, Gold)<br>
                Watering Can (Flimsy, Colorful, Outdoorsy, Elephant, Gold)<br>
                Slingshot (Flimsy, Colorful, Outdoorsy, Gold)<br>
                Vaulting Pole<br>
                Ladder<br>
                Wand
            </code>
            <h2>What consumes durability?</h2>
            <p>Different actions consume durability in different ways for each tool, for example, hitting a rock with a
                flimsy axe consumes one durability, but rocks interact with tools differently than trees. If you hit a
                rock with one durability left on an axe, that axe won't break until the rock "timer" is up. Where as if
                you hit a tree with a one durability axe, it will break on the first hit. Any other activity other than
                what's listed will not consume durability, and brief overview of what consumes durability for each tools
                is below, noting that vaulting poles, ladders, and wands do NOT break.</p>
            <code>
                Axe - hitting a tree or rock<br>
                Shovel - hitting a rock, digging up a stump/flower/tree<br>
                Net - catching an object<br>
                Fishing Rod - catching a fish<br>
                Watering Can - watering a flower, at a lower percentage, watering anything/nothing<br>
                Slingshot - shooting a balloon</code>
            <h2>How much can I expect from each?</h2>
            <p>Here's how many smacks each tool can take, noting that variant tools (Colorful, Outdoorsy, etc) have the
                same durability as the "iron" versions and do
                not include the Golden tools. As you can see, Golden tools outside of the watering can are largely not
                worth.</p>
            <code>
                    Tool: Flimsy, Variant, Golden<br>
                    Axe: 40, 100, 200<br>
                    Shovel: 40, 100, 200<br>
                    Net: 10, 30, 90<br>
                    Fishing Rod: 8-10, 30, 90<br>
                    Watering Can: 20, 60, 180<br>
                    Slingshot: -, 20, 60
                </code>
            <h2>Exceptions to note</h2>
            <p>There are a few exceptions to note, namely watering cans. The flimsy version will water a single spot,
                where the variant will do a 2 x 3 spot, and the golden will do a 3 x 3 spot. This is probably the only
                case
                where upgrading is a real value. Also note that some flowers can only be produced by hybrids with a gold
                can.</p>
            <p>The final important note, which I haven't gotten around to seeing if they patched it out yet, is that
                customizing tools (with a customization kit) effectively gives you a new tool, so a shovel with 99
                smacks on it will basically have the durability reset for one kit, which is 600 bells. Hope this helps!

            <h1>DIY Bug Islands</h1>
            <div class="desc">Got an excess of Nook Miles? Turn those Nook Miles into bells with some DIY
                bug islands. Strap in, this is a long one…</div>
            <h2>Transforming Nook Miles into bells</h2>
            <p>There's a few ways to trade your Nook Miles to bells, from bell vouchers to straight selling tickets,
                which, at the time of posting are going for around 125,000 each on average. Selling tickets is the
                fastest way to do it, but if you don't feel like dealing with other people or taking the trading risk,
                DIY bug islands can turn a decent profit, with an inventory mostly full of tarantulas or scorpions
                netting you 300,000 plus (or 450,000 plus with Flick) on the high end, with the super lazy low end still
                being 80,000. Personally, I make about 150,000 on average from each island, bringing back only a third
                of my inventory full of the good bugs.</p>
            <h2>What's the catch?</h2>
            <p>See what I did there? The most lucrative bugs we can catch on these islands only spawn after 1900, which
                means bug islands are really only valuable at night. Also, if you're just starting, you won't have the
                40 slot pockets yet either, so there's that…</p>
            <h2>I'm good with that, how do I start?</h2>
            <p>First things first, we need to get the right island. Most islands will work just fine, and some will work
                much better than others. Islands with three levels and/or 5 rocks on em, give those a hard pass and
                count yourself unlucky. Pretty much every other island will work, as long as you see bugs somewhere when
                you get there.</p>
            <p>How many bells you go home with is based on time and luck. Luck being getting good bug spawns and a good
                layout, and time being how long you want to stay to chase the higher value bugs.</p>
            <h2>What are these high value bugs?</h2>
            <p>Our bounty. We'll be targeting these main bugs, based on sell value: tarantula/scorpion at 8000 each,
                atlas moth at 3000, and giant water bugs at 2000. Ideally we want to bring back as many
                tarantulas/scorpions as possible, but random spawns mean it can take a long time to get a full inventory
                of them.</p>
            <p>The main idea is to remove the spawn conditions for as many bugs as possible, so we can force these
                specific critters to spawn.</p>
            <h2>Preparing the island</h2>
            <p>Controlling the spawns means almost razing the island. Pick all the flowers, break all the rocks, chop
                all the trees (except the coconut), and dig up all the stumps. We leave the coconut trees for the Atlas
                moths to spawn on. Giant water bugs will spawn in the rivers, and tarantulas/scorpions will generally
                spawn on the grassy areas. There are two other bugs that will need to be cleared, tiger beetles and
                wharf roaches on the shore rocks. Simply running through them is enough to chase them away, and give us
                room for our target spawns. Water bugs are a pain though, cause the only way to clear them is to catch
                them… One important thing to note here, is that if you dig up a spot, bugs won't spawn there. So for
                those two level islands with no waterfall, dig up that top! By removing almost everything from the
                island, we again limit the bugs that can spawn.</p>
            <h2>Setting the trap</h2>
            <p>Now to lay the trap. It's simple, draw an 'H' somewhere with your shovel. When you see a tarantula or
                scorpion, as you approach it, it'll go up on its legs. If you move at all during this point, it'll start
                chasing you, and that's the goal. Have it chase you into your clever trap, and jump through, like below.
                It'll get stuck on the other side, catch it, and profit.</p>
            <p>At any point in time, you'll have a minimum of 2 bugs on your island. If it's a water bug, rip you, you
                have to catch it. Again, tiger beetles and roaches can just be scattered by running through em, be sure
                to check your coconut trees for Atlas moths as well.</p>

                <figcaption class="figcaption">It's a trap!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> I'll be sure to keep this updated as the months change, currently, in May, there are scorpions on the
                Northern Hemisphere, and water bugs are going to be a pain the whole summer...</p>
